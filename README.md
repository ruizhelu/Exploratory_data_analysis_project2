# Exploratory_data_analysis_project2

This a clear version of Ruizhe Lu's course project 2 in Exploratory_data_analysis in Coursera.

The codes of 6 plots are from easy ideas with 3 plotting methods in both base and ggplot2.(plot, qplot, ggplot)

The plots are all stored in PNG files with a format of 900x480.

It is just a record of what I have done with this project.
